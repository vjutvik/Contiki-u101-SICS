/*
  I2C operations implemented somewhat according to app. note AN2824 -
  ("STM32F10xxx I2C optimized examples") using polling read and write.
  Warning, i2c_read() makes you sad.

  It appears to be this complicated because of certain limitations
  in silicon.

  "Due to the 'Wrong data read into data register' limitation described
  in the device errata sheet, interrupts should be masked between STOP
  programming and DataN-1 reading.  Please refer to the device errata
  sheet for more details."

  "The EV6_1 software sequence must complete before the ACK pulse of
  the current byte transfer. To ensure this, interrupts must be disabled
  between ADDR clearing and ACK clearing."

  Not sure if masking of interrupts is enough, or if we actually need
  to disable *all other* interrupts in order to keep within timing
  constraints.
